# 6: The Study of Angles
At last, we are ready to build our first app. Since we actually want this to be a useful app, we're going to make ourselves a Homework Reminder app. Here's the "elevator pitch" for the thing:

>Mirman students need better ways to track the work they need to do. Moodle helps, but it isn't enough. It's time we took ownership of our homework with a tool designed exactly for our needs. Forget Notes. Forget Reminders.

Introducing **name of app**.

Yeah, I haven't thought of a name yet. That's for us to decide. What I *do* know is that it will be a web-based AngularJS app using Firebase as a backend to store user data. That means logging in. But we don't want to have to store user passwords if we can get away with it, so we'll use our Google accounts to log in, and offload authentication to Google.

Thanks, Google!
